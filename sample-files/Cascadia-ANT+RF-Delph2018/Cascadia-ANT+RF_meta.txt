# The following parameters define the model parameters for constructing the metadata.
# All parameters should follow the CF Metadata Conventions (https://cfconventions.org/).

# Rules:
# Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored
# Each parameter should be defined on a new line with key=value format (quotes are not required)
# Lines starting with "-" indicate a new parameter definition
# Lines starting with ">" indicate a new parameter grouping.
#    - Each parameter group should contain one or more parameter definition (key=value) on a new line 
#    - The leading and trailing blank spaces are ignored
# Lines starting with ">>" indicate a new parameter sub-grouping.
#    - Each parameter sub-group should be nested under a parameter group
#    - Each parameter sub-group should contain one or more parameter definition (key=value) on a new line 
#    - The leading and trailing blank spaces are ignored

# DataSet group:
# This parameter is required for HDF5 output files only and it will be used, if provide, to create a
# subgroup under the root group for the dataset.
# datasets represented by this metadata file
# NOTE: An empty dataset_group will place the data under the main group.
# NOTE: Duplicate dataset_group may result in variable conflicts and code failure.
#
- dataset_group =  VELOCITY

# Delimiter:
# The delimiter used to separate data columns.
#
# data: delimiter for the input CSV data file. 
# geocsv: delimiter for the output GeoCSV file(S).

# variables
# A compilation of model variables metadata. 
# Repeat the >> subgroup for as many variables as needed.
#
# Each model variable metadata includes:
# column: The column heading in the data file:
# variable: the model variable name. It is recommended to use a CF-compliant standard name. 
# Please consult the Guidelines for Construction of CF Standard Names
# (https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/docs/guidelines.html).
# long_name: Text that describes the variable more fully.
# display_name: Text to use for variable display. 
# grid_ref: Text A recognized grid coordinate system (Currently supporting, latitude_longitude and mercator)
# data_source:  describes the origin of the data for this variable:
#       If the data is derived from observations, the source attribute should be set to “data-derived.”
#       If the data is derived from an empirical formula, the source attribute should indicate how the variable was derived.
#
#       For example:
#            >> vp
#               data_source = data-derived
#            >> vs
#               data_source = assumed to follow vp as vs = vp / 3
